# Secure-Journaling-Web-Application
This project aims to create a secure journaling web application where users can safely store their private journal entries using AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode) encryption. The application ensures data confidentiality and integrity, allowing users to access their entries only with a password.
